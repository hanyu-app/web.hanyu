      <p><strong>Analytics Providers/Advertisers:</strong> We may share information with analytics providers and advertisers to assist us in implementing and evaluating relevant advertising. Typically, this information is collected from you through cookies and other tracking technologies on our Hanyu Services.</p>

      <p><strong>Other Parties When Required by Law:</strong> There may be instances when Hanyu disclose Your Personal Information to other parties:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>to comply with our legal obligations, including with auditors, lawyers, CPAs, financial consultants, or other consultants;</li>
        <li>to comply with the law or respond to legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity or law enforcement;</li>
        <li>to detect, limit, and prevent fraud, or verify and enforce compliance with the policies governing our Hanyu Services; or</li>
        <li>to protect our rights, company property, and safety of other company employees; and</li>
        <li>where otherwise required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing of Personal Information</h2>

      <p>Hanyu discloses Your Personal Information in limited circumstances to Hanyu's affiliates, our service providers, in order to provide our Hanyu Services and to improve your experience. Where required by applicable law, Hanyu will only share Your Personal Information for this very limited purpose.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Provide You with Hanyu Services, for example, to set up and maintain your account, to process payments and orders, to verify user information;</li>
        <li>Respond to or fulfill customer service requests;</li>
        <li>Analyze, better tailor, and improve our Hanyu Services;</li>

        <li>Comply with our legal obligations and enforce our legal rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing Your Personal Data Internationally</h2>

      <p>Since Hanyu is a company with a principal place of business in the United States, any Personal Information that we collect in and through the Hanyu Services for the purposes outlined above may be transferred to, stored on servers in, and accessed from the United States and countries other than the country in which the Personal Information was initially collected. Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your country of residence. By using the Hanyu Services you agree to your Personal Information being transferred outside your original territory and subject to the terms in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>How Hanyu Stores Your Data and Security</h2>

      <p>The security of all Personal Information provided to Hanyu is important to us. Hanyu uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect Your Personal Information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Hanyu regularly conducts security reviews, vulnerability scans, and/or penetration tests to ensure compliance with industry security practices and standards. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Hanyu strives to protect Your Personal Information, Hanyu cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that You transmit to Hanyu, and You do so at Your own risk. As such, Hanyu asks that You help us be safer together by implementing Your own security controls, such as a strong password, not sharing Your credentials with others, logging out when You are done using our Hanyu Services, and other security best practices.</p>

      <p>Hanyu will keep Your Personal Information in compliance with its data retention policy or until You request to delete it. Once this time period has expired, Hanyu will delete all related data.</p>

      <h2>Do We Use Cookies</h2>

      <p>When You interact with our Hanyu Services, we obtain certain information using automated technologies, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. These technologies help us to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it;</li>
        <li>Track and understand how you use and interact with our online services and emails;</li>
        <li>Tailor our online services to your preferences;</li>
        <li>Measure how useful and effective our services and communications are to you; and</li>
        <li>Otherwise manage and enhance our products and services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>

      <p><strong>Session Cookies.</strong> Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Services.</p>

      <p><strong>Persistent Cookies.</strong> Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.</p>

      <p><strong>Disabling Cookies.</strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Services who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p>

      <p><strong>Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.</strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web and app pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.</p>

      <p><strong>Third Party Analytics.</strong> We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site. We use these tools to help us improve the performance of our Site and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services. To learn more about Google's privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.

      <p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals.</strong> Please note that our Site does not recognize or respond to any signal which your browser might transmit through the so-called "Do Not Track" feature your browser might have.</p>
