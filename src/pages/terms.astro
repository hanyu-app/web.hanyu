IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE AMOUNT COLLECTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

      <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>

      <p>Any proceeding(s) to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither You nor Hanyu will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected proceedings. You and Hanyu also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or any consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Hanyu is a party to the proceeding. You are giving up Your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim You may have against us including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations.</p>

      <h2>Terms of Use Revisions</h2>

      <p>Hanyu may at any time revise these Terms of Use by updating this posting. By continuing to use this Hanyu Services, You agree to be bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to determine the then current Terms of Use to which You are bound.</p>

      <h2>Jurisdiction</h2>

      <p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the state of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree that any disputes or claim arising out of or in connection with the Terms of Use shall be adjudicated in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California.</p>

      <h2>General</h2>

      <p>You and Hanyu agree that any and all disputes, except those that are resolved informally or brought in a small claims court, will be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST HANYU. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).</p>

      <h3>Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>

      <p>Before an arbitration is commenced, You or Hanyu agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a dispute informally. Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms of Service. To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice ("Notice"). Any Notice to Hanyu should be sent by email to <a href="mailto:support@hanyu.app">support@hanyu.app</a>. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration.</p>

      <h3>Scope of Arbitration</h3>

      <p>If the parties are not able to resolve the dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") administered by the American Arbitration Association (<a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.adr.org</a>) according to this Section and the Commercial Arbitration Rules for that forum, except You and Hanyu will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and to request that the AAA's Expedited Procedures apply regardless of the claim amount.</p>

      <h3>Small Claims Court</h3>

      <p>Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis.</p>

      <h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>

      <p>The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16, including its procedural provisions, fully applies. Any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or videoconference. The Arbitrator's award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other result of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

      <h3>Opt Out</h3>

      <p>You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any dispute. To reject this provision, You must send us an opt-out notice (the "Opt Out") within thirty (30) days after You create a Hanyu account or we first provide You with the right to reject this provision.</p>

      <h2>Fulfillment &amp; Refund Policy</h2>

      <p>Upon successful payment, users receive immediate access to Hanyu's premium features. Access is provided through our mobile app, available on iOS and Android. No physical goods are delivered.</p>

      <p>We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for purchases made directly through our website. To request a refund, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@hanyu.app">support@hanyu.app</a>. Refunds are processed to your original payment method.</p>

      <p>Note: Purchases made through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store are subject to their respective refund policies and must be requested through those platforms.</p>
