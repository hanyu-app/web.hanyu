4. AlternativeTo (competitor traffic capture)
5. BetaList (waitlist signups)
6. SaaSHub + Startup Stash + CrozDesk (batch in one session)

## Notes on Link Value

- **Dofollow confirmed**: Futurepedia, ToolPilot, Dang, SaaSHub, AlternativeTo, Crunchbase
- **Nofollow but high-value for traffic**: Product Hunt, G2, Capterra, Hacker News
- **Spam to avoid**: General web directories (e.g., DMOZ clones, random DA-30 link farms) — no value in 2026

## Unresolved Questions

1. Does TAAFT (theresanaiforthat.com) accept waitlist-only products, or require a live app?
2. Which Product Hunt category fits best — "Education", "AI" or "Language Learning"?
3. Are there dedicated Chinese learning / Mandarin app communities (Reddit r/ChineseLanguage, HelloTalk forums) worth a submission post separate from SEO directories?
